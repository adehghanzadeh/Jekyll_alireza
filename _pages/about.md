Hello

I'm a graduated student from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in Biosystem Engineering. I've done _four_ project during my bachelor degree at [University of Tabriz](https://tabrizu.ac.ir/en).
I was a part of [Precistion Agriculture group](http://infoag.ir/en/)([_Linkedin_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/precision-agriculture-research-team/)) during last two years of my bachelor degree.

I worked on four group project (two lecture based and two industerial project) and so I learnt about programming algorithms, Adruiono, electrical circuts and automation. more details can be found in [Projects](https://alirezad.ir/projects/) section.
My master thesis was based on Machine Learning which helped me dive into understanding Python and Machine Learning.

My curiosity in age of 17 directed me to Ubuntu, and three years later, when I was working on a project, I decided to switch to Linux-based Operating systems. Due to my inspiration to coding, I started a hobby project to bypass internet limitation (in Iran) which lead me to learning Docker and more-Linux. Thoughts of having a personal website pushed me to learn about frontend development and NodeJS ([Here is why](https://blog.alirezad.ir/posts/use-notion-as-cms-for-jekyll/)).

All in all, I decided to focus on some special fields and they are: Coding (Python, Go, JavaScript, Docker, frameworks and etc.), Web Application Security and Machine Learning.

Time makes opportunities!
