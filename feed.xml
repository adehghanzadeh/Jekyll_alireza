I was studying in a public school (as named in wikipedia) and got accepted to enter University of Tabriz in 2016.</p> <p>I’m that type of guys which focus on subjects that I like, so because of that, I studied only some specific courses during high school very well, so I couldn’t get a great score. (in Konkour, we have to study lots of courses. for example: Persian literature, Islamic education, Arabic and English in general section and Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in specialized section) so, I liked math and physics in high school and I studied them very well, so the lack of other courses, lowered my scores</p> <h2 id="bachelor">Bachelor</h2> <p>In university, it took time for me to get comfortable with new situation (I lived in Meymeh, a small town a hundred kilometers away from Esfahan).</p> <p>In forth semester, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hossein-Behfar">Dr. Hossein Behfar</a> invited interested students to go further in Electronics and have one/two groups and work constantly under his supervises. That was my first step in applied electronics and fundamental of my future projects.</p> <p>In sixth semester, our electronic groups broke up and I was looking for ways to earn back my interactions with projects and team works. Short while after, I met <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hossein-Navid">Dr. Hossein Navid</a> who help me to find my way and introduced me to <a href="http://infoag.ir/en/">Precision Agriculture group</a>. I worked on two project under name of this group. meanwhile, I was working on a class project for course “Mechanical Engineering Design” with four great students from our class.</p> <p>You can check <a href="https://alerezaa.ir/projects/">project section for more details</a>.</p> <p>Maybe one day, I’ll write a brief post about my bachelor degree but for now It time to write about Master degree.</p> <h2 id="master">Master</h2> <p>My Master degree journey started in 2020, several month after Corona Virus lockdown, just after I finished my bachelor. First two semesters were lecture based, and due to lockdown, I had no interaction with university environment.</p> <p>Finally, we could stay in dormitories with cautions and I got in touch with academic environment. I met my supervisor (who I talked to him before, during lockdown) and he told me about several topics which were not my mindset.</p> <p>My professor had a project which was not even close to my background or field of interest, so I had to convince them to integrate my field of interests with his field of study, and after lots of sessions, the result was my master thesis:</p> <h2 id="thesis">Thesis</h2> <p><em><strong>Developing a machine learning algorithm to enhance image reconstruction in Electrical Capacitance Tomography (case study: bulk solid flow measurement)</strong></em></p> <p>I had a mixture feeling at first days but a little after, I end up with this idea: “I’m working on Machine Learning subject, professor said he will help me with ECT fundamentals (cause it takes lots of month to learn) and I have little interaction with ECT part”</p> <p>So, I started to expand my knowledge about Machine Learning. We had a course which taught by Prof. Mahmoud Omid, I really enjoyed that lecture.</p> <p>I knew about ML and I had some small information about it, but, by taking that course, I got familiar with machine learning concepts and worked practically on it. It was a set small, in-class homeworks, but useful for acquiring knowledge.</p> <p>Due to coronavirus lock down, I couldn’t get into university (dormitory) till start of 4th semester and soon after, I submited my proposal because I had to submit it, but the fact is, due to some problem with the instrument which I use its data, I had to wait a little bit.</p> <p>It was a good rime to expand my knowledge about ML, Python programming and Cybersecurity.</p> <p>I requested for financial aid of Coursera on Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, and thankfully, I could get it. (Certification in my <a href="https://cv.alerezaa.ir/">CV</a>)</p> <p>First, in March 31th, my supervisor sent a database of data. 56 set of data. I started working on that. I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scikit-learn</code> to work on data. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogisticRegression</code> , <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogisticRegressionCV</code> , <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SVM</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k-nearest neighbot</code> models are used to train a model for enhancement, but, as I expected, they did not work properly because numbers are not seperatable linearly or based on any classical ML model.</p> <p>There are two pair of data:</p> <ul> <li>Simulator ↔ LBP (Linear Back Projection)</li> <li>Simulator ↔ TekhonoV</li> </ul> <p>These two reconstruction methods are among fastest with lower computational cost.</p> <h3 id="classic-machine-learning-models">Classic Machine Learning models</h3> <p>NOTE: I include only some key sections in my writing.</p> <h4 id="logistic-regression">Logistic Regression</h4> <p>Its the simplest model any starter can involve with.</p> <p>No regularization, No tweak.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="n">sklearn.linear_model</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">LogisticRegression</span>

There is a course in Coursera as well</p> <p>Thesedays, there are many different modules written by expertise to-do machine learning tasks more easier and with a less information and knowledge!</p> <p>So think about this a little the more, if you would like to get more familiar with machine learning mathematical fundamentals this is one of the greatest courses available but if you like to learn about machine learning and and write code in Python or any other programming languages without great knowledge of mathematical fundamentals you have to go for other courses available</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Based on recent works on machine learning models mostly based on python, maybe it’s better to go for a course to learn machine learning in Python</p> <h2 id="whats-next">whats next</h2> <p>I am involved with another machine learning course offered by Fun-Mooc whitch I started recenetly.</p> <p>It’s mostly about scikit-learn and how to work with data using scikit learn in Python.</p> <p>My background knowledge in machine learning gathered from Coursera ML course, AI course in university and other sources, is really helpful in this scikit learn course.</p> <p>I will apply for <em>Deep Learning Specialization</em> offered by Coursera in the future, and I really hope they approve my aid for financial. The course needs 5 month to complete as Coursera mentioned, I think thats a great 5 month</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="course"/><category term="machine learning"/><category term="Computer Science"/><category term="mathematics"/><category term="Matlab"/><category term="Octave"/><category term="Coursera"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine Learning Course introduced by Andrew Ng, offered by coursera]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Idea behind my blog</title><link href="https://alerezaa.ir/blog/2022/the-idea-behind-my-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Idea behind my blog"/><published>2022-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://alerezaa.ir/blog/2022/the-idea-behind-my-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alerezaa.ir/blog/2022/the-idea-behind-my-blog/"><![CDATA[<blockquote> <p>In the name of the God of Rainbow</p> </blockquote> <p>I’m writing this post, better say, my first post, in days of being upset for the kid, Kiyan Peerfalak, and the phrase “In the name of the God of Rainbow” was used by him.

Deploy it ON Cloudflare</em> 😎 Hmmmm, what is JAMstack?</p> <details> <summary>jamstack.org says: </summary> <blockquote> <p>Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.<br/> Jamstack removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience.<br/> It enables a composable architecture for the web where custom logic and 3rd party services are consumed through APIs.<br/> ~ <a href="https://jamstack.org/">https://jamstack.org/</a></p> </blockquote> </details> <p></p> <p>In addition, struggling with infrastructure (eg. pure Linux, webservers, blogging platforms like wordpress, unpredictable traffics and so on) is time consuming and I dont really like to deal with them again 😬 so, in JAMstack, everything is ready, you only have to focus on writing and and blog.</p> <p>The same thing is true about IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) which I will create a small post about Docker later in my <a href="https://blog.alerezaa.ir">Blog</a>.</p> <details> <summary>IaaS vs PaaS </summary> <ul> <li>IaaS: In simple word, its like a VPS but based on cloud software and possibility to rent hourly.</li> <li>PaaS: To know more search about Docker and Containers</li> </ul> <p>in summary:</p> <p>This picture show the parts that companies provide based on type of service (in IaaS, they provide you network and servers)</p> <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I1IUtZ-xTWO0JHAV9Q4yismgXU4jjh_mCD8RsFg47auVdeKNeEl3YUKHx3vH8saEnwyf-BHl8jjmbGWWzJViq024uis01Sh48JPO99PT8Agw9R4BTnp-ufZZuklpNLZTaLrpXpxJAg=w600" alt=""/></p> </details> <p></p> <p>I just realized that there are several other great providers (Firebase (by Google), Layer0 and Netlify) and only Firebase &amp; Layer0 can be competitor to Cloudflare Pages.
