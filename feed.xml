There is a course in Coursera as well</p> <p>Thesedays, there are many different modules written by expertise to-do machine learning tasks more easier and with a less information and knowledge!</p> <p>So think about this a little the more, if you would like to get more familiar with machine learning mathematical fundamentals this is one of the greatest courses available but if you like to learn about machine learning and and write code in Python or any other programming languages without great knowledge of mathematical fundamentals you have to go for other courses available</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Based on recent works on machine learning models mostly based on python, maybe it‚Äôs better to go for a course to learn machine learning in Python</p> <h2 id="whats-next">whats next</h2> <p>I am involved with another machine learning course offered by Fun-Mooc whitch I started recenetly.</p> <p>It‚Äôs mostly about scikit-learn and how to work with data using scikit learn in Python.</p> <p>My background knowledge in machine learning gathered from Coursera ML course, AI course in university and other sources, is really helpful in this scikit learn course.</p> <p>I will apply for <em>Deep Learning Specialization</em> offered by Coursera in the future, and I really hope they approve my aid for financial. The course needs 5 month to complete as Coursera mentioned, I think thats a great 5 month</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning"/><category term="course"/><category term="machine learning"/><category term="Computer Science"/><category term="mathematics"/><category term="Matlab"/><category term="Octave"/><category term="Coursera"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine Learning Course introduced by Andrew Ng, offered by coursera]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Idea behind my blog</title><link href="https://alireza.pages.dev/blog/2022/the-idea-behind-my-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Idea behind my blog"/><published>2022-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://alireza.pages.dev/blog/2022/the-idea-behind-my-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alireza.pages.dev/blog/2022/the-idea-behind-my-blog/"><![CDATA[<blockquote> <p>In the name of the God of Rainbow</p> </blockquote> <p>I‚Äôm writing this post, better say, my first post, in days of being upset for the kid, Kiyan Peerfalak, and the phrase ‚ÄúIn the name of the God of Rainbow‚Äù was used by him.

Deploy it ON Cloudflare</em> üòé Hmmmm, what is JAMstack?</p> <details> <summary>jamstack.org says: </summary> <blockquote> <p>Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.<br/> Jamstack removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience.<br/> It enables a composable architecture for the web where custom logic and 3rd party services are consumed through APIs.<br/> ~ <a href="https://jamstack.org/">https://jamstack.org/</a></p> </blockquote> </details> <p></p> <p>In addition, struggling with infrastructure (eg. pure Linux, webservers, blogging platforms like wordpress, unpredictable traffics and so on) is time consuming and I dont really like to deal with them again üò¨ so, in JAMstack, everything is ready, you only have to focus on writing and and blog.</p> <p>The same thing is true about IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) which I will create a small post about Docker later in my <a href="https://blog.alerezaa.ir">Blog</a>.</p> <details> <summary>IaaS vs PaaS </summary> <ul> <li>IaaS: In simple word, its like a VPS but based on cloud software and possibility to rent hourly.</li> <li>PaaS: To know more search about Docker and Containers</li> </ul> <p>in summary:</p> <p>This picture show the parts that companies provide based on type of service (in IaaS, they provide you network and servers)</p> <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I1IUtZ-xTWO0JHAV9Q4yismgXU4jjh_mCD8RsFg47auVdeKNeEl3YUKHx3vH8saEnwyf-BHl8jjmbGWWzJViq024uis01Sh48JPO99PT8Agw9R4BTnp-ufZZuklpNLZTaLrpXpxJAg=w600" alt=""/></p> </details> <p></p> <p>I just realized that there are several other great providers (Firebase (by Google), Layer0 and Netlify) and only Firebase &amp; Layer0 can be competitor to Cloudflare Pages.
